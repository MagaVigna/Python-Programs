Data structures are generally used to organise data. 
In python we use four types of data structures, list, dictionary, tuples and sets. 
Categorising similar data and referencing them under same name is called as data structures. 
Like in list we can group elements of different data type and call it with a single name. 
Tuples are same like lists but they are immutable that is their values cannot be changed once they are declared and values have been initiated. 
In python all four data structures are one dimensional. 
They are stored in a single row or column continuously. 
In Dictionary we can store the values in key:value format. 
Whereas set is a keyless dictionary and the values are always stored in ascending order.
